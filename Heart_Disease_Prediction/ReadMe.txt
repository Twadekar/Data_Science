Algorithm:
Decision Tree Classifier


Objective:
To develop a machine learning model using the Decision Tree Classifier that can accurately predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on key medical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, chest pain type, and more.
The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
