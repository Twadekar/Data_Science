📊 Problem Statement
Predict if a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck using supervised machine learning. The target variable is:
Survived:
0 = Died
1 = Survived



⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)


✅ Model Used
Logistic Regression – Used to classify passengers into Survived or Died.
